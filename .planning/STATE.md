# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-23)

**Core value:** A single script that works everywhere POSIX (and PowerShell) — zero dependencies, curl-pipe-bash ready — with a professional interactive menu that fetches and executes modular install scripts on demand.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — TUI Engine Core

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (TUI Engine Core)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Context gathered

- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- (Roadmap): 7 research phases consolidated to 6 with coarse granularity — Terminal Primitives + Menu Widget merged into Phase 1
- (Phase 1 context): tui.sh — single file, source+function API, shell-aware hybrid input, full-screen box rendering, auto-detect Unicode, configurable key timeout

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **POSIX portability risk:** Existing checklist.sh has bashisms ($'\033', echo -e, GNU sed \x1b) that must be fixed in Phase 1. Every line needs ShellCheck -s sh validation.
- **Escape sequence timing over SSH:** dd-based key reading has timing issues over high-latency connections. stty min/time inter-byte timeout needs empirical validation across dash/ash/busybox.
- **PowerShell 5.1 ANSI support:** PS 5.1 doesn't support ANSI escape sequences natively — Phase 6 will need a completely separate TUI implementation approach.
